# This is a complete " Tic Tac Toe " game using HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

## In this projects I added a timer funciton for each player's turn. Each player must complete his/her turn within this time. Otherwise, player must lose his/her turn. 

## In this game I added the counting functionality. How many times player "X" or player "O" has own, it will be counted.
